		"date": "2019-05-29",
		"article":"<p>In the process of Security Token Offering (STO), KYC (Know Your Customer) is a vital link, which is an important prerequisite for mutual trust among issuance platforms, regulatory authorities, projects, investors and other related parties.</p><br /><p>With the further development of STO, its globalization becomes more apparent and the digital identity of investors is increasingly important. For the STO activities registered with or unregistered from the authorization of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), investors need to go through the KYC process for accredited investor qualification, and their sources of funds are also subject to anti-money laundering (AML) investigation.</p><br /><p>Today, Blocklike invited Mr Qu Ming, an expert in the KYC field and founder of IDHub and Magic Circle. He will lead us to understand in depth the main processes and significance of KYC in the ST field.</p><br /><br /><p>KYC (Know Your Customer)</p><br /><p>It should be noted that KYC is the most basic logic in all financial fields.</p><br /><p>In the financial industry, KYC refers to the process by which a exchange platform obtains and identifies customer-related identification information, which is a basic requirement. Its purpose is to identify customers, ensure that unqualified users have no access to the offering services provided by the platform, and provide investigation basis for law enforcement agencies in future criminal investigations. At present, it mainly includes verifying the customer’s identity information and the identity of the actual beneficiary of transactions, confirming the customer’s risk profile, reviewing the customer’s financial records, investigating the source of transaction funds and the customer’s affiliates, etc.</p><br /><p>On the basis of KYC, there is AML (Anti-Money Laundering) measure. AML basically refers to a series of laws and regulations formulated to prevent investors from entering the capital market using income from illegal transactions. There are institutions that regularly review transactions and capital flows. For AML, different banks or institutions adopt different coping strategies.</p><br /><p>The review procedures for KYC and AML include: verifying the customer’s basic identity information and the identity of the actual beneficiary of transactions, confirming the customer’s current business status and risk profile, and investigating the source of transaction funds and the customer’s affiliates, etc.</p><br /><p>CFT (Combating the Financing of Terrorism) is more special. At present, each jurisdiction has its definition of “anti-terrorism”. For example, the United States has a special agency responsible for supervision. If a certain transaction involves a company located in a special region, a CFT investigation will be launched.</p><br /><p>From the perspective of ST, what are issued should be regular stocks or bonds of a normal company. For the issuer, it is very important to know exactly who is benefiting from its stock. Of these three areas, CFT is arguably the most important. Once there is a problem in this aspect, there will be great harm.</p><br /><p>For example, in the United States where the STO industry is at the forefront, regulation of these three areas is both overlapping and independent. </p><br /><br /><p>The importance of digital identity in STO</p><br /><p>Speaking of STO, first of all, this is a securities investment, different from the investment in cryptocurrency. Take the United States as an example, investor qualification is needed for securities purchase; that is, certification of qualified investors should be carried out on the basis of KYC.</p><br /><p>It should be emphasized that KYC is different from accredited investors. For KYC, the most basic and true information is needed to prove personal identity. For accredited investors, investors need to prove that they have the qualifications and assets to invest in the high-risk investment, such as requirements for annual income, requirements for stock investment experience and the basis for relevant financial interaction. This is a multi-round, complex interaction process.</p><br /><p>If these two criteria are met, securities can be traded. </p><br /><p>This requirement raises the threshold for auditing. Even for a legalized STO program in the United States, there are limitations for ordinary people due to the accredited investor review. But for lawmakers, it’s a protecting the investors.</p><br /><p>From a certain perspective, every country has similar regulations. For example, to open an account in China’s NEEQ, there will be requirements for investment experience and verification of asset sources. The logic is similar.</p><br /><p>For the ST issuance platform, this logic can also be seen in some security token standards: although KYC standards are not involved, some identity requirements are still incorporated, and there are some restrictions on the number of transactions and the identity of participants.</p><br /><p>At present, both STO and the cryptocurrency market are open to global flows and transactions. Different countries have different requirements for KYC and different KYC service providers. However, due to the fact that they cross national borders, the information provided by these service providers is not enough, and name translation alone will make information vague. However, there is a lot of room for improvement of the existing problems with KYC. I believe these problems will be solved with the optimization and adjustment of regulatory measures and the improvement of decentralized digital identity technology based on blockchain .</p><br /><br /><p>KYC and Break the Liquidity Dilemma</p><br /><p>In this case, digital identity will play a huge role in the ST field. The existing KYC mode mainly includes four aspects i.e. customer identity information, platform audit, KYC cost and update frequency. Different STO platforms have different requirements for KYC. The platform KYC cost is relatively high, with an average of 50-60 USD/person. The cost is relatively high and the database needs to be updated regularly.</p><br /><p>The current complicated KYC process is likely to be simplified in the future, the bottom line of which remains regulatory compliance. However, repeated verification of information can be avoided.</p><br /><p>For STO in the United States, every institution should have its own KYC and the personal information of investors is verified upon offering. If the blockchain is taken as the basic framework of identity and the information required to be disclosed by law is connected to a distributed blockchain network through the verification mode of on-chain + off-chain, the blockchain will allow the information to be copied to all nodes and stored permanently. In this way, users can check with the same identity in different scenes, enhancing the efficiency of account review and solving the privacy protection of sensitive information. Similarly, users’ information can be updated in one place and pushed to the organizations they are cooperating with to avoid repeated verification. This also provides a trustworthy and unchangeable audit trail for financial institutions, regulators and other stakeholders.</p><br /><p>The valid identity should be digitally signed on the blockchain so that other intermediaries in the STO process can safely use the signature. Digital identity can realize the confirmation of rights and transactions for digital securities, which is its greatest role in the ST field.</p><br /><p>To solve the lack of liquidity issue in the ST industry, the portability of assets should be addressed first.</p><br /><p>The lack of liquidity in the ST industry is not related to the adequacy of funds. The main reason is that there are not enough clients reached and assets are “locked up” in platforms without a liquidity premium. A brand-new tool outside platforms is needed to realize the portability of assets, so that platforms can “return” assets to customers and make the assets portable. This is also what Magic Circle hopes to achieve: one-time compliance verification of all digital asset platforms through decentralized digital identity, breaking down the liquidity barrier caused by different standards of platforms.</p><br /><p>The transaction of security tokens is actually the transfer of ownership. Assets belong to investors, allowing the original investors to really have the right to manage, carry and transfer their own assets conveniently. The problem of liquidity can be easily solved.</p><br /><p>STO is still in its early stage of exploration. It’s believed that as KYC develops and improves, it will truly bring global free liquidity to the industry.</p>",

As the observer and practitioner, Founder of IDHub Foundation and Magic Circle, Mr Qu stated that, Security Token will lead the global Paradigm Revolution.</p><br /><br /><span class='pic' style='margin: 2px 70px 9px 0;'><img src='images/news-p03.jpg' alt=''></span><br /><br /><p><p>Mr Qu believes that security token are more complaint, and they change the centralized settlement schema, in other words, they realize the auto complaice and quick settlement. Security tokens also enable assets segmentation, which lowering the entry threshold for high risk targets such as real estate and arts.</p><br /><p>Security token market is currently in an early stage, and it is also the breakthrough of finance innovation.It is the field most likely to force regulatory innovation through technology and bridge the gap between financial innovation and compliance regulation.It is expected that in the next 2-3 years, the security token market will continue to show a steady rise trend and usher in the full implementation of supervision.</p><br /><p>Among all infrastructure of security tokens, DID is the core to enhance the compliance. DID can be used to claim ownership of digital assets, and hand control of the assets back to users instead of platforms through enabling assets portability. Thus, users can carry their digital assets cross platforms, to release liquidity. Security token has programmability. It allows regulators putting regulation model, capital management into the smart contract, to the largest extent to avoid human factor interruption, which helps to increase financial efficiency, and promote security token compliance management.</p><br /><p>Finally, Mr Qu believes that security token is not the end of the path, but is the start of Decentralized Finance. It will fully stimulate people's imagination on the future finance and create a new financial and regulatory paradigm.</p></p>",
