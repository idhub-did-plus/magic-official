		"date": "2019-05-29",
		"article":"<p>In the process of Security Token Offering (STO), KYC (Know Your Customer) is a vital link, which is an important prerequisite for mutual trust among issuance platforms, regulatory authorities, projects, investors and other related parties.</p><br /><p>With the further development of STO, its globalization becomes more apparent and the digital identity of investors is increasingly important. For the STO activities registered with or unregistered from the authorization of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), investors need to go through the KYC process for accredited investor qualification, and their sources of funds are also subject to anti-money laundering (AML) investigation.</p><br /><p>Today, Blocklike invited Mr Qu Ming, an expert in the KYC field and founder of IDHub and Magic Circle. He will lead us to understand in depth the main processes and significance of KYC in the ST field.</p><br /><br /><br /><p>KYC (Know Your Customer)</p><br /><p>It should be noted that KYC is the most basic logic in all financial fields.</p><br /><p>In the financial industry, KYC refers to the process by which a exchange platform obtains and identifies customer-related identification information, which is a basic requirement. Its purpose is to identify customers, ensure that unqualified users have no access to the offering services provided by the platform, and provide investigation basis for law enforcement agencies in future criminal investigations. At present, it mainly includes verifying the customer’s identity information and the identity of the actual beneficiary of transactions, confirming the customer’s risk profile, reviewing the customer’s financial records, investigating the source of transaction funds and the customer’s affiliates, etc.</p><br /><p>On the basis of KYC, there is AML (Anti-Money Laundering) measure. AML basically refers to a series of laws and regulations formulated to prevent investors from entering the capital market using income from illegal transactions. There are institutions that regularly review transactions and capital flows. For AML, different banks or institutions adopt different coping strategies.</p><br /><p>The review procedures for KYC and AML include: verifying the customer’s basic identity information and the identity of the actual beneficiary of transactions, confirming the customer’s current business status and risk profile, and investigating the source of transaction funds and the customer’s affiliates, etc.</p><br /><p>CFT (Combating the Financing of Terrorism) is more special. At present, each jurisdiction has its definition of “anti-terrorism”. For example, the United States has a special agency responsible for supervision. If a certain transaction involves a company located in a special region, a CFT investigation will be launched.</p><br /><p>From the perspective of ST, what are issued should be regular stocks or bonds of a normal company. For the issuer, it is very important to know exactly who is benefiting from its stock. Of these three areas, CFT is arguably the most important. Once there is a problem in this aspect, there will be great harm.</p><br /><p>For example, in the United States where the STO industry is at the forefront, regulation of these three areas is both overlapping and independent. </p><br /><br /><br /><p>The importance of digital identity in STO</p><br /><p>Speaking of STO, first of all, this is a securities investment, different from the investment in cryptocurrency. Take the United States as an example, investor qualification is needed for securities purchase; that is, certification of qualified investors should be carried out on the basis of KYC.</p><br /><p>It should be emphasized that KYC is different from accredited investors. For KYC, the most basic and true information is needed to prove personal identity. For accredited investors, investors need to prove that they have the qualifications and assets to invest in the high-risk investment, such as requirements for annual income, requirements for stock investment experience and the basis for relevant financial interaction. This is a multi-round, complex interaction process.</p><br /><p>If these two criteria are met, securities can be traded. </p><br /><p>This requirement raises the threshold for auditing. Even for a legalized STO program in the United States, there are limitations for ordinary people due to the accredited investor review. But for lawmakers, it’s a protecting the investors.</p><br /><p>From a certain perspective, every country has similar regulations. For example, to open an account in China’s NEEQ, there will be requirements for investment experience and verification of asset sources. The logic is similar.</p><br /><p>For the ST issuance platform, this logic can also be seen in some security token standards: although KYC standards are not involved, some identity requirements are still incorporated, and there are some restrictions on the number of transactions and the identity of participants.</p><br /><p>At present, both STO and the cryptocurrency market are open to global flows and transactions. Different countries have different requirements for KYC and different KYC service providers. However, due to the fact that they cross national borders, the information provided by these service providers is not enough, and name translation alone will make information vague. However, there is a lot of room for improvement of the existing problems with KYC. I believe these problems will be solved with the optimization and adjustment of regulatory measures and the improvement of decentralized digital identity technology based on blockchain .</p><br /><br /><br /><p>KYC and Break the Liquidity Dilemma</p><br /><p>In this case, digital identity will play a huge role in the ST field. The existing KYC mode mainly includes four aspects i.e. customer identity information, platform audit, KYC cost and update frequency. Different STO platforms have different requirements for KYC. The platform KYC cost is relatively high, with an average of 50-60 USD/person. The cost is relatively high and the database needs to be updated regularly.</p><br /><p>The current complicated KYC process is likely to be simplified in the future, the bottom line of which remains regulatory compliance. However, repeated verification of information can be avoided.</p><br /><p>For STO in the United States, every institution should have its own KYC and the personal information of investors is verified upon offering. If the blockchain is taken as the basic framework of identity and the information required to be disclosed by law is connected to a distributed blockchain network through the verification mode of on-chain + off-chain, the blockchain will allow the information to be copied to all nodes and stored permanently. In this way, users can check with the same identity in different scenes, enhancing the efficiency of account review and solving the privacy protection of sensitive information. Similarly, users’ information can be updated in one place and pushed to the organizations they are cooperating with to avoid repeated verification. This also provides a trustworthy and unchangeable audit trail for financial institutions, regulators and other stakeholders.</p><br /><p>The valid identity should be digitally signed on the blockchain so that other intermediaries in the STO process can safely use the signature. Digital identity can realize the confirmation of rights and transactions for digital securities, which is its greatest role in the ST field.</p><br /><p>To solve the lack of liquidity issue in the ST industry, the portability of assets should be addressed first.</p><br /><p>The lack of liquidity in the ST industry is not related to the adequacy of funds. The main reason is that there are not enough clients reached and assets are “locked up” in platforms without a liquidity premium. A brand-new tool outside platforms is needed to realize the portability of assets, so that platforms can “return” assets to customers and make the assets portable. This is also what Magic Circle hopes to achieve: one-time compliance verification of all digital asset platforms through decentralized digital identity, breaking down the liquidity barrier caused by different standards of platforms.</p><br /><p>The transaction of security tokens is actually the transfer of ownership. Assets belong to investors, allowing the original investors to really have the right to manage, carry and transfer their own assets conveniently. The problem of liquidity can be easily solved.</p><br /><p>STO is still in its early stage of exploration. It’s believed that as KYC develops and improves, it will truly bring global free liquidity to the industry.</p>",

		"article": "<p>In Sep 3rd, Magic Circle has been invited to the ‘Security Token--the key to break global liquidity’ event hosted by STOCOOP. As the observer and practitioner, Founder of IDHub Foundation and Magic Circle, Mr Qu stated that, Security Token will lead the global Paradigm Revolution.</p><br /><br /><span class='pic' style='margin: 2px 70px 9px 0;'><img src='images/news-p03.jpg' alt=''></span><br /><br /><p><p>Mr Qu believes that security token are more complaint, and they change the centralized settlement schema, in other words, they realize the auto complaice and quick settlement. Security tokens also enable assets segmentation, which lowering the entry threshold for high risk targets such as real estate and arts.</p><br /><p>Security token market is currently in an early stage, and it is also the breakthrough of finance innovation.It is the field most likely to force regulatory innovation through technology and bridge the gap between financial innovation and compliance regulation.It is expected that in the next 2-3 years, the security token market will continue to show a steady rise trend and usher in the full implementation of supervision.</p><br /><p>Among all infrastructure of security tokens, DID is the core to enhance the compliance. DID can be used to claim ownership of digital assets, and hand control of the assets back to users instead of platforms through enabling assets portability. Thus, users can carry their digital assets cross platforms, to release liquidity. Security token has programmability. It allows regulators putting regulation model, capital management into the smart contract, to the largest extent to avoid human factor interruption, which helps to increase financial efficiency, and promote security token compliance management.</p><br /><p>Finally, Mr Qu believes that security token is not the end of the path, but is the start of Decentralized Finance. It will fully stimulate people's imagination on the future finance and create a new financial and regulatory paradigm.</p></p>",

		"article": "<p>Magic Circle,the creative ST service provider officially held a working meeting in Shanghai Xingli Science and Technology Innovation Space from November 12th to 14th.</p><br /><br /><span class='pic' style='margin: 2px 70px 9px 0;'><img src='images/news-p04.jpg' alt=''></span><br /><br /><p>The two-day meeting was held in two directions: technology and market. In terms of technology, the research and development of Magic Circle-related technologies is progressing steadily, and the basic functions of the DID wallet and platform are being developed in an orderly manner. The DID wallet has released a beta version for internal testing. Features include Ethereum wallet function, identity management function, claim related function, scan code login function, dapp browser function, support for internal test ST, etc., and  ST on-chain compliance is preliminary designed.</p><br /><p>Qu Ming, chairman of the IDHub Foundation and founder of MagicCircle, said that Magic Circle is an enterprise that is driven by innovative blockchain technology to provide infrastructure in the field of crypto finance. By focusing on and deepening the ST field, Magic Circle is committed to providing the industry with an efficient, secure, and convenient one-stop digital service for assets, covering the entire process from ST issuance, compliance, trading to investment. Service provider is also the first platform to provide UT and ST aggregation services.</p><br /><p>For users, Magic Circle will allow them to fully perceive the joy of innovation investment. Through continuous innovation of concepts, models and technologies in the ST field, they will explore more interesting and imaginative innovation investments for users, and convey that investment is a pleasure Value proposition and the brand spirit of independence, professionalism, value innovation, and open collaboration.</p><br /><p>Magic Circle's US market partner Mikhail LaPushner introduced the rapid development of ST in the US market, while focusing on ST's exploration in the sports, music and Hollywood industries. According to him, as of March 2019, 122 STO projects have been successfully issued, raising a total of US $ 512 million. At present, 54 digital securities products are in the process of issuance. Of a total of 328 STO projects, only 12 failed to issue, accounting for only 3.65%. It can be seen that ST is becoming a potential innovative financing method and a value expression form of the digital economy. Especially in the sports, music and film fields, ST is expected to provide new financing channels for small and medium-sized innovative enterprises. It is recognized and applied by more and more enterprises.</p><br /><p>As a strategic investment partner of Magic Circle, SAF Investment Fund partner Ben Ng fully recognizes the development potential of ST as a new financing method, and is looking forward to the future prospects of Magic Circle. Ben Ng said that ST has changed the traditional financing model and promoted the efficient circulation of assets in a more fragmented and granular way. Both investors and issuers will benefit from this, and now global financial regulators and traditional financial institutions are also benefiting from the new technology of blockchain. It is believed that in the near future, as a pioneer in this field, Magic Circle will provide a more convenient infrastructure for global asset liquidity through standardized ST technology.</p><br /><p>At present, Magic Circle has reached cooperation with a number of partners in the digital identity, crypto funds, and ST fields, including MyGo, Asia's first real estate crypto hedge fund, and Asia's first tokenized venture capital fund for the blockchain field. Atlas Fund, Hiro Art Foundation, a ST project centered on world-renowned artist trust funds, IDHub Foundation, the world's leading decentralized digital identity organization, and CryptoFin Lab, a research institution focusing on digital asset development, will further introduce more cooperation in the future Partners to jointly build a free, fair and efficient innovative trading ecosystem.</p><br /><p>When the trend of global economic integration and financial liberalization is irresistible, the financial revolution driven by blockchain technology will exceed imagination. People will need borderless, efficient and credible trading environments, and all of this requires us to start with infrastructure construction. As an innovative ST service provider, Magic Circle will make efforts for this.</p>",

These assets include replaceable assets such as currency, stable assets and utility tokens; irreplaceable assets such as bills; securities and other restricted Alternative assets; and restricted non-replaceable assets such as licenses and certificates. Algorand not only helps chess media companies achieve their goal of raising funds, but also provides technology to accurately store some online rating data on the blockchain to prevent these data from being tampered with.</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><p>US Senators: Facebook’s Libra, Stablecoins Are Securities Under Existing Law</p><br /><p>Yesterday, Representatives Sylvia Garcia (D-TEX) and Lance Gooden (R-TEX) proposed a new bill which would officially declare both Libra and other ‘managed stablecoins’ securities. While introducing the bill, Garcia explicitly called out Libra, claiming it and other Stablecoins “are clearly securities under existing law”. Both Garcia and Gooden are members of the House Financial Services Committee.</p><br /><br /><span class='pic' style='margin: 2px 70px 9px 0;'><img src='images/news-p05-2.jpg' alt=''></span><br /><br /><p>Regulators around the globe have been notably hesitant to support the development of Libra.

Even G7 — an intergovernmental organization comprised of seven of the world’s leading economies — has produced reports highlighting the risks that assets such as Libra pose.</p><br /><p>Regulators around the globe have been notably hesitant to support the development of Libra. US Lawmakers have expressed growing concerns over Libra’s ability to rival the US dollar and ultimately, the US economy. Even G7 — an intergovernmental organization comprised of seven of the world’s leading economies — has produced reports highlighting the risks that assets such as Libra pose.</p><br /><p>Besides the concern over its risks along with the role of big data integrated with financial services, there remains ambiguity when it comes to Libra’s legal classification. Since its inception, Facebook has repeatedly stated Libra would not be deemed a security. However, US Congressman Warren Davidson (R-OH) previously said he thinks Libra should be regulated as a security — the same stance proposed by the new legislation submitted by US Senators yesterday.</p><br /><p>If the legislation sees approval, Libra would constitute a security token. Yet Facebook has consistently argued against Libra as a security. In contrast, the social media giant has said Libra will be backed by several currencies, including the US dollar. Facebook’s crypto executive David Marcus has claimed Libra is drastically different from both securities and other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><p>UK Task force: Virtual Currencies Are Property Under UK Law</p><br /><p>A group of legal experts from the UK have published a 46-page legal document outlining the relation between digital assets and smart-contracts with existing English law. The document was produced after a six-month long consultation. The group was chaired by a senior member of the judiciary.The document ultimately concludes that digital assets and blockchain encrypted smart contracts fall under existing English law. Certain digital assets — which include but are not limited to ‘virtual currencies’ — can be treated ‘in principle’ as property. In addition, smart-contracts were also identified as able to satisfy the existing contract requirements under English law.</p><br /><br /><span class='pic' style='margin: 2px 70px 9px 0;'><img src='images/news-p05-3.jpg' alt=''></span><br /><br /><p>In this case, smart-contracts are then enforceable by English courts. To take things a step further, private key encryption was found to satisfy the statutory requirements for a signature. According to Sir Geoffrey Vos, chancellor of the High Court, the news signifies “a watershed for English law and the UK’s jurisdictions. No other jurisdiction has attempted anything like it.” The document did note that the treatment of every digital asset ultimately depends on several factors — suggesting analysis on a case by case basis. These factors can include the nature of the asset, the existing rules for that type of asset, and the relative purpose. The document did read however, that “cryptoassets have all of the indicia of property”.</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><p>New York Regulator Approves Fidelity Digital Assets to Offer Bitcoin Custody/Trading</p><br /><p>Recently, the New York State Department of Financial Services has issued Fidelity a trust license that allows it to provide Bitcoin trading and escrow services. DFS said that Fidelity will establish a digital asset subsidiary and launch a digital currency custody and execution platform. On this platform, institutional investors and individuals can securely store, buy, sell, and transfer Bitcoin.</p><br /><br /><span class='pic' style='margin: 2px 70px 9px 0;'><img src='images/news-p05-4.jpg' alt=''></span><br /><br /><p>Last month, Abigail Johnson, the chief executive of the investment group, told the Financial Times that it was initially an attempt, but it has now evolved into real action, aimed at hedge funds and family offices. Establish a viable password escrow business with financial advisor clients.</p><br /><p>To date, New York State has issued 23 licenses to companies involved in virtual currency transactions in the state. Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Justice issued a license to Intercontinental Exchange, the world's second largest exchange group by market value, allowing it to host Bitcoin futures through its digital asset unit, Bakkt. The move shows that New York, like Switzerland and Malta, is eager to make itself the center of crypto asset trading.</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><p>Openfinance Seeks to Raise $50 Million</p><br /><p>The popular security token exchange, Openfinance filed a Form D with the SEC this week. The company seeks to raise $50 million to further development of its secondary trading platform and security token ecosystem. The news demonstrates growing interests in the security token sector, specifically, exchanges that add liquidity to the market.</p><br /><br /><span class='pic' style='margin: 2px 70px 9px 0;'><img src='images/news-p05-5.jpg' alt=''></span><br /><br /><p>According to the SEC filing, Openfinance seeks to secure around $50 million to accomplish its new strategy. Interestingly, the company already raised $8.6 million successfully according to executives. Notably, this initial funding came from a variety of international investors. In total, 19 different investors participated in the first stage of the crowdfunding event so far.</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><p>Polymath has fallen out of love with ethereum.</p><br /><p>The security token issuer has migrated its Polymesh blockchain onto Substrate, the platform developed by ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood’s Parity Technologies. Polymesh becomes one of the first blockchains to make the jump. Polymath first announced it was building the Polymesh blockchain in May.</p><br /><br /><span class='pic' style='margin: 2px 70px 9px 0;'><img src='images/news-p05-6.jpg' alt=''></span><br /><br /><p>At the center of contention is ethereum’s consensus mechanism, proof-of-work (PoW), which only offers a statistical guarantee of transaction finality. Polymath’s ST20 security token (built on ethereum’s ERC-1400 standard) and native POLY token (an ERC-20) will journey over to the new Substrate-based chain, the firm's head of blockchain, Adam Dossa, said in an email. A bridge for POLY tokens will be maintained for at least one year.</p><br /><p>”Security tokens need to be flexible,” Dossa said. “There might be some very custom compliance logic you may need. We wanted to give people the option in a rich and flexible way.”</p>",
